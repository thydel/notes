Following various posts about _"OpenSSH to deprecate SHA-1 logins due
to security risk"_ I searched google for [ssh rsa key deprecated][]
and found

- [OpenSSH 8.3 released (and ssh-rsa deprecation notice)][]
- [Upgrade your SSH keys!][]

So I went to check all our user ssh keys (`ssh-keygen -lf`), only to
find I read too fast (or should I say I only read title) and
misunderstood the point which is about _"public key signature"_ and
not key.

In fact [Upgrade your SSH keys!][] was published on 23 Sep 2016, but
was still useful because some users have RSA 1024 bit key which are
deprecated.

Then, trying to understand OpenSSH [release-8.3][] I found that

Is probably typo, because

```console
$ ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa localhost
command-line line 0: Bad key types '-ssh-rsa'.
```

While `ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa localhost` works

Now, if I guess correcly, I can check that all our nodes have an
`ecdsa` host key

```
ansible g_poweredon -boa 'ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub'
```
