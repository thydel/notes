title: Clone remote bare git

# The problem

- I have two connected location, `manin` and `wato`.
- I have one node on each location for redondant remote git,
  `git.manin` and `git.wato`.
- Each git node keeps similar set of bare git repos.
- So I usually `git push manin` and `git push wato` from anywhere and
  have no other backup.
- The `wato` connection was broken for months.
- I created a `new` bare repo on `manin` and cloned it on some other
  nodes.
- The `wato` connection was repaired, but the `manin` connection then
  broke, leaving me without any remote `new`.

# The solution

On any node with an up to date clone of `new`

```bash
clone --bare new new.git
rsync -av new.git git.wato:~
```

On any node wanting to switch `new` from broken `manin` to newly cloned `wato`

```bash
git remote add wato git.wato:~/new.git
git fetch wato
git remote set-head wato master
git branch -u wato
git pull
```
