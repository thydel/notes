# The context

- I work from different locations using different desktops (intead of
  an unique travelling laptop) and some parts of my environment tend
  to split away
- We use `pass` at work to maintain `GPG` encrypted secrets in some `git` repos
- We have `ansible` playbooks in others `git` repos that update these `pass` repos

# The problem

- GPG keys aren't in a repos, they are in each user home dir

# The fix

On a node missing some colleague `GPG` key

Given

- `ok.here` a WS which have the key
- `ko.there` a WS which doesn't have the key
- `a.colleague@work.tld` the Key ID of a colleague

From `ko.there`

```bash
ssh ok.here gpg --export -a a.colleague@work.tld | gpg --import
ssh ok.here gpg --export-ownertrust | gpg --import-ownertrust
```
