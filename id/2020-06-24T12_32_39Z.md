# The context

- I use [pass][] with git
- I have more than one workstation
- One of them kept a obsolete key in his keyring
- This obsolete key had a similar UID as the up-to-date one

# The problem

- GPG quietly use one of the two keys (the wrong one in this case)
  without any warning
- This resulted in a situation where I can't decrypt a new pass added
  on a workstation with both keys (the old one and the new one) on a
  workstation with the new key only

# The Fix

## First find all pass encrypted using the wrong key

The obsolete key is the one that I created with an expiration date

```bash
keyid=$(gpg -k $(git config user.email) | grep -A 1 '^pub.*expires' | tail -1)
subkeyid=$(gpg --list-keys --with-colons $keyid | awk -F: '$1 == "sub" { print $5; }')
```

Finding subkey id could be easier

```bash
gpglist="echo -n '{} '; gpg2 --batch --list-packets {} 2>&1"
passd=~/.password-store
gpgfind () { find  $passd/ -type f -name '*.gpg' | xargs -i echo "$gpglist" | dash | grep  encrypted\ with; }
gpgfind | grep $subkeyid | awk '{print$1}' | sed -e s^$passd/^^  -e 's/.gpg$//' > ~/tmp/2redo
```

## Then extract all wrongly encrypted pass

Generate a script that will recrypt them all using still present
obsolete key (this tmply script contains clear version of pass to be
recrypted)

```bash
< ~/tmp/2redo xargs -i echo "echo echo \$(pass {}) \| pass insert -e {}" | dash > ~/tmp/redo
```

## And remove them all

```bash
< ~/tmp/2redo xargs -i echo pass rm -f {} | dash
```

## Now we can remove obsolete key

```bash
gpg -k $keyid # check what we'll remove
gpg --delete-secret-and-public-key $keyid
```

## And replay redo script

```bash
dash ~/tmp/redo
pass git push
```

## Check the fix

```bash
ssh -A $elsewhere pass git pull
< ~/tmp/2redo | ssh -A $other xargs -i pass {}
```

## Remove redo script

```
rm ~/tmp/redo
```
