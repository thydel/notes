[§2020-06-12T11:11:38Z]: 2020-06-12T11_11_38Z.md "§ Work with multiple remotes"

After pushing to multiple remotes I usually also want to update all
remote nodes using these repos to keep everything in sync.

Note that all nodes keeping a bare repo are not necessarily the same
as all nodes keeping a clone.

Also note that this assume all clones share the same path.

First I congifure my peers, e.g. from hypothetical work location, the
two other places where I have a workstation.

```bash
git config local.peers ws.manin
git config --add local.peers ws.wato
```

Then I add the onliner as a git alias

```bash
git config alias.sync '!git config --get-all local.peers | xargs -i echo ssh -An {} git -C $(pwd) pull'
```

Now `git sync | dash` will sync all remote clone, and assuming the
conf to [§ Work with multiple remotes][§2020-06-12T11:11:38Z] is OK `git
push; git sync | dash` will keep in sync all remote bares and clones.

But [git-extras][] has a `git-sync` command and Git aliases cannot shadow existing Git command.

Uses `msync` instead of `sync`

```bash
git config alias.msync '!git config --get-all local.peers | xargs -i echo ssh -An {} git -C $(pwd) pull'
```
